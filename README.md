## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

This project leverages a free currency exchange rate API to provide real-time data.

1.  **API Integration**: The application makes an asynchronous `fetch` call to the **Currency API** (`@fawazahmed0/currency-api`) to get the latest exchange rates for the selected "From" currency.
2.  **Dynamic Dropdowns**: On page load, the JavaScript code dynamically populates the "From" and "To" dropdown menus with a list of available currency codes.
3.  **Flag Updates**: When a user changes the currency in either dropdown, the application fetches the corresponding country flag from the **Flags API** (`flagsapi.com`) and updates the UI.
4.  **Conversion Logic**:
    -   A user enters an amount and clicks the "Convert" button.
    -   An API call is made to get the conversion rates for the base currency.
    -   The specific rate for the target "To" currency is extracted from the JSON response.
    -   The final converted amount is calculated and displayed to the user.
5.  **Swap Functionality**: The swap button reverses the selected values of the "From" and "To" dropdowns and updates their respective flags.
